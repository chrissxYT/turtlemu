# TurtlEMU - A ComputerCraft emulator
## Disclaimer
This emulator is not production ready and you shouldn't use it.  
Also it does not try to emulate the whole ComputerCraft, but it might
do it anyways in the future.  
## Thanks to
* [the Lua people](https://lua.org) for that scripting language
* [dan200](https://github.com/dan200) for the Minecraft mod
* [crazy German people](http://intern.fh-wedel.de/~si/seminare/ws09/Ausarbeitung/09.lua/lua5.htm) for a tutorial on how to do this kind of stuff
